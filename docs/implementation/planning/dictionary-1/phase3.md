# **Phase 3 Plan: Performance Optimization**

**Objective:** To ensure the dictionary feature is fast, scalable, and resilient under load by implementing a multi-layered caching strategy using Redis. This phase is critical for providing a production-ready, responsive user experience.

### **Key Tasks**

1. **Caching Infrastructure Setup**:  
   * Integrate **Redis** into the application's infrastructure.  
   * Configure the NestJS CacheModule to use redis-store as its primary cache store, making it available globally throughout the application.  
2. **Layer 1: Automated Response Caching**:  
   * Apply the NestJS CacheInterceptor using the @UseInterceptors() decorator on all public, high-traffic GET endpoints.  
   * **Target Endpoints**:  
     * GET /languages  
     * GET /dictionary/`{lang-code}`/`{word}`  
     * GET /dictionary/search/`{lang-code}`
   * Define appropriate Time-to-Live (TTL) values for each endpoint's cache using @CacheTTL(). For example, a long TTL for /languages and a shorter TTL for search results.  
3. **Layer 2: Granular Service-Level Caching**:  
   * Inject the CacheManager (@Inject(CACHE\_MANAGER)) directly into the DictionaryService.  
   * Identify computationally expensive or frequently accessed data queries within the service that are not fully covered by Layer 1 caching.  
   * **Primary Target**: The logic that fetches and assembles the full declension and conjugation tables.  
   * Implement manual caching: Before executing the database query, check if the result exists in the cache using cacheManager.get(). If not, execute the query and store the result using cacheManager.set() with a custom key (e.g., declension:`{wordId}`).  
4. **Cache Invalidation Strategy**:  
   * Implement a robust cache invalidation mechanism to prevent stale data.  
   * In the service logic for all administrative write endpoints (POST /words, PATCH /words/`{id}`, DELETE /words/`{id}`), manually and precisely delete the relevant cache keys from Redis using cacheManager.del().  
   * **Invalidation Targets**: This must include both the Layer 1 response cache key (e.g., for GET /dictionary/de/Hund) and any associated Layer 2 granular cache keys (e.g., declension:`{wordId}`).  
5. **Performance and Load Testing**:  
   * Use a load testing tool (e.g., k6, JMeter) to benchmark the performance of the primary lookup and search endpoints **before and after** implementing caching.  
   * Simulate high-traffic scenarios to verify performance gains, measure the reduction in API latency, and confirm the decrease in database load.

### **Dependencies**

* Successful completion of **Phase 1 and Phase 2**.  
* A provisioned Redis instance accessible from the application environment.  
* Access to a load testing tool and environment.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

* **Infrastructure**: The NestJS application is successfully connected to and using Redis as its cache store.  
* **Caching Functionality**:  
  * Making a second identical request to a cached GET endpoint returns a response significantly faster and does not trigger a new database query (verified via logging or monitoring).  
  * The Redis database contains keys corresponding to both API responses and granular service-level data.  
* **Invalidation**:  
  * Updating a word entry via the PATCH /words/`{id}` endpoint successfully deletes all related cache entries.  
  * A subsequent GET request for that word retrieves the fresh, updated data from the database and re-populates the cache.  
* **Performance Metrics**:  
  * Load testing demonstrates at least a **70% reduction** in average response time for cached endpoints under load.  
  * Database CPU and I/O metrics are measurably lower during load tests compared to the pre-caching baseline.

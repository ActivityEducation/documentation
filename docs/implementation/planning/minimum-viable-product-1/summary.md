# **EducationPub MVP Completion Plan: Executive Summary**

This document serves as the central overview for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) completion of the EducationPub platform. The MVP aims to establish a foundational, functional, and federated social and education platform, leveraging ActivityPub and a custom EducationPub vocabulary focused on Flashcards.  
The plan is structured into five distinct, sequential phases, each addressing critical aspects of development to achieve a stable, interoperable, and fully validated system ready for initial deployment.

## **MVP Scope Confirmation**

As defined in the project's scope.md, the MVP prioritizes the following capabilities:

* **Local User Management:** Registration, login, and basic profile access.  
* **Core ActivityPub Federation:** Actor profiles, Inbox/Outbox functionality, Follow/Unfollow, and collection endpoints (followers, following, liked).  
* **EducationPub \- Flashcard Focus:** Creation, federation, dereferencing, and listing of edu:FlashcardModel and edu:Flashcard objects. Standard ActivityPub interactions (Like, Announce, Update, Delete) for these objects.

Explicitly **out of scope** for this MVP are other EducationPub object types, extended EducationPub activities (e.g., Submit, Review), advanced social features (mentions, groups, DMs), real-time notifications, and complex UI/UX beyond basic demonstration.

## **Phased Implementation Plan**

The MVP completion will be executed in the following logical sequence:

* **Phase 1: Foundational Corrections and Data Model Refinement**  
  * Focus: Addressing immediate data integrity issues and enhancing the core data model.  
  * [Link to Phase 1 Document](./phase-1.md)  
* **Phase 2: Core Module Repository Setup**  
  * Focus: Ensuring all necessary TypeORM repositories are correctly provided to the CoreModule before feature implementation.  
  * [Link to Phase 2 Document](./phase-2.md)  
* **Phase 3: Implement Missing Core Endpoints and Dereferencing**  
  * Focus: Implementing primary missing endpoints and ensuring content dereferencing.  
  * [Link to Phase 3 Document](./phase-3.md)  
* **Phase 4: Architectural Refactoring of Module Dependencies**  
  * Focus: Resolving critical architectural violations and refining module responsibilities.  
  * [Link to Phase 4 Document](./phase-4.md)  
* **Phase 5: Final Verification and End-to-End Validation**  
  * Focus: Comprehensive testing and simulation to ensure system stability and MVP success criteria.  
  * [Link to Phase 5 Document](./phase-5.md)  

Each phase document provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for an AI agent, including specific file locations, code modifications, and expected outcomes. This structured approach ensures a systematic and verifiable path to MVP completion.

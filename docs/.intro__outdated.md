# What is EducationPub?

EducationPub is a free, open-source platform designed for sharing, learning, and teaching educational resources online. It empowers individuals and organizations to create their own educational spaces that can connect and interact with a larger network of learning platforms.  
Unlike centralized social media, EducationPub platforms are built, managed, and moderated by their owners. This means there's no single, opaque moderation policy or algorithm dictating what you see. Instead, the software provides you with the tools to make your own connections and discover content relevant to you.  

Every EducationPub instance can integrate with others, forming a **vast, interconnected network** of educators and learners across the internet, often referred to as the "Fediverse."

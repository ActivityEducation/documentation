# **Posting to Your EducationPub Profile**

Sharing content is at the heart of EducationPub\! Whether you're an educator sharing a lesson or a learner tracking your progress, your profile is where your contributions shine. This guide will show you how to create and share different types of educational resources.

## **How to Create a New Post**

The process for creating a new post or educational resource is generally similar across EducationPub platforms:

1. **Find the "Create" or "New Post" Button:**  
   * Look for a prominent button or icon, often labeled "Create," "New Post," "Publish," or a "+" symbol. This is typically found in your main navigation, dashboard, or directly on your profile page.  
2. **Choose Your Content Type:**  
   * EducationPub supports a variety of specialized educational content types. After clicking "Create," you might see options like "New Flashcard," "New Story," "New Exercise," or "New Objective." Select the type of content you want to create.  
3. **Fill in the Details:**  
   * A form will appear, tailored to the content type you selected. Fill in all the necessary information. This might include:  
     * **Title/Name:** A descriptive title for your content.  
     * **Content/Text:** The main body of your post, story, or prompt.  
     * **Media:** Options to upload or link to audio, video, or images.  
     * **Specific Fields:** Unique fields depending on the educational resource (e.g., "Word" and "Definition" for a flashcard, "Questions" for a self-assessment).  
     * **Language/Level:** Information about the target language or difficulty level.  
4. **Add Tags (Optional):**  
   * Most platforms allow you to add "tags" or "hashtags" to your content. These are keywords that help others discover your posts. For example, \#FrenchVocabulary, \#Algebra, \#HistoryLesson.  
5. **Set Visibility (Optional):**  
   * You might have options to control who can see your post (e.g., "Public," "Followers Only," "Unlisted").  
6. **Publish Your Post:**  
   * Once you're satisfied, click the "Publish," "Create," or "Post" button. Your content will then appear on your profile and be shared with your followers and the wider Fediverse, depending on your visibility settings.

## **Types of Educational Resources You Can Create**

EducationPub goes beyond simple text posts, allowing you to create rich, structured educational materials:

* ### **Flashcards & Flashcard Models**

  * **What they are:** Digital flashcards for memorization and recall. You can define the structure of your flashcards (e.g., "Front" and "Back" fields, or "Word," "Definition," "Audio" fields) using a **Flashcard Model**, and then create individual **Flashcards** based on that model.  
  * **Use for:** Vocabulary learning, concept review, fact memorization, language acquisition.

* ### **Stories**

  * **What they are:** Narrative texts designed for reading and listening comprehension. They can include built-in glossaries for difficult words and comprehension questions.  
  * **Use for:** Language practice, literature study, general reading comprehension.

* ### **Video Lessons**

  * **What they are:** Video-based educational content. You can embed videos and add transcripts, comprehension questions, and even interactive elements that appear at specific points in the video.  
  * **Use for:** Visual learning, tutorials, lectures, skill demonstrations.

* ### **Self-Assessments**

  * **What they are:** Quizzes or tests designed for learners to check their own understanding. They can contain various question types like multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, short answer, and even audio responses.  
  * **Use for:** Self-testing, practice, gauging comprehension.

* ### **Writing Prompts**

  * **What they are:** Specific instructions or ideas to inspire a writing activity. You can suggest a word count, topics, or a target audience for the writing.  
  * **Use for:** Creative writing, essay practice, language composition.

* ### **Exercises & Pronunciation Exercises**

  * **What they are:** General learning activities or drills. A specialized **Pronunciation Exercise** allows you to provide a word or phrase and a reference audio, so learners can practice their pronunciation.  
  * **Use for:** Skill practice, drills, language pronunciation training.

* ### **Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)**

  * **What they are:** A way to set and track your learning goals. An **Objective** is a high-level goal (e.g., "Become fluent in Spanish"), and **Key Results** are the measurable steps you take to achieve it (e.g., "Complete 10 speaking exercises," "Learn 500 new vocabulary words").  
  * **Use for:** Goal setting, progress tracking, personal learning management.

## **Interacting with Content (Submitting & Reviewing)**

Beyond creating new content, you can also:

* **Submit Responses:** For **Self-Assessments** and **Writing Prompts**, you can submit your answers or written work, which might be automatically graded or reviewed by others.  
* **Provide Peer Reviews:** For certain submissions (like writing), you might be able to offer **Peer Reviews**, providing constructive feedback to other learners.

By utilizing these diverse content types, EducationPub allows you to tailor your sharing and learning experience to your specific educational needs.

# **Using EducationPub Content Externally**

EducationPub is designed to be an open and interconnected platform. This means you're not limited to just sharing content within your EducationPub instance; you can also easily share and even embed your educational resources on other websites, blogs, or platforms\!

## **1\. Sharing Links to Your Content**

The simplest way to share your EducationPub content is by sharing its direct link (URL). Every piece of content you create – whether it's a Flashcard, Story, Video Lesson, or Objective – has its own unique web address.

* **How to find the link:**  
  * Navigate to the specific Flashcard, Story, Video Lesson, or other resource you want to share.  
  * Look for a "Share" icon (often an arrow pointing upwards or a chain link symbol) or simply copy the URL from your browser's address bar.  
* **Where to share:** You can paste this link anywhere:  
  * In an email to a student or colleague.  
  * On your personal blog or website.  
  * In a chat application.  
  * On other social media platforms.

When someone clicks the link, it will take them directly to that content on your EducationPub instance.

## **2\. Embedding EducationPub Content with oEmbed**

For a richer experience, EducationPub supports **oEmbed**. This powerful feature allows you to embed interactive versions of your educational resources directly into compatible external websites, just like you might embed a YouTube video or a tweet.

### **What is oEmbed?**

oEmbed is a standard that allows a website to display a "rich" preview of content from another site, simply by providing a URL. Instead of just a plain link, oEmbed lets the external site automatically generate an interactive player or a well-formatted preview of your EducationPub content.

### **What You Can Embed:**

With oEmbed, you'll be able to embed various types of interactive educational resources, including:

* **Flashcards:** Embed a playable flashcard directly into your blog post or lesson plan on another site.  
* **Video Lessons:** Integrate the video player for your educational videos.  
* **Stories:** Display a preview of your educational stories, potentially with interactive elements.  
* **Self-Assessments:** Embed quizzes or exercises for direct interaction.  
* **Pronunciation Exercises:** Allow users to practice pronunciation directly on your external site.  
* **And more\!** As EducationPub evolves, more content types will become embeddable.

### **How to Embed Content Using oEmbed:**

The process is remarkably simple on most compatible platforms:

1. **Copy the URL:** Go to the specific EducationPub content (e.g., a Flashcard, Video Lesson) you want to embed and copy its full URL from your browser's address bar.  
2. **Paste into a Compatible Platform:**  
   * Go to your external website, blog editor, or learning management system.  
   * Simply paste the copied EducationPub URL directly into the content editor.  
   * Many modern platforms (like WordPress, Notion, Medium, or certain LMS text editors) will automatically detect the oEmbed link and transform it into the rich, interactive embedded content.  
   * **Note:** Some platforms might require you to use a specific "Embed" block or option in their editor.

### **Benefits of Embedding:**

* **Rich Previews:** Instead of just a link, your audience sees an interactive preview or the full playable content.  
* **Seamless Experience:** Learners can engage with your educational materials without leaving the external website.  
* **Increased Engagement:** Interactive content is more engaging and can improve learning outcomes.  
* **Wider Reach:** Share your specialized educational content with audiences on platforms they already use.

## **3\. How EducationPub Content Appears on Other Fediverse Platforms**

When you post public content on your EducationPub instance, it can also be seen by users on other Fediverse platforms (like Mastodon, Pixelfed, or other EducationPub instances) if they follow you.

* **Graceful Degradation:** Even if another Fediverse platform doesn't fully understand the specific interactive features of an EducationPub Flashcard or Video Lesson, it will still display the basic information (like the title, description, and a link) so users can still discover and click through to your content on your EducationPub instance.  
* **Full Experience:** Users on other EducationPub instances will see your content with its full interactive capabilities.

By leveraging these external sharing and embedding features, your educational content on EducationPub can reach a global audience, making learning more accessible and interactive across the web.

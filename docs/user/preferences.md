# **Set Your Preferences on EducationPub**

Customizing your preferences allows you to tailor your EducationPub experience to your needs and how you like to learn and interact. Taking a few moments to adjust these settings can significantly improve your daily use of the platform.

## **Accessing Your Preferences**

Most preference settings can be found in your account or profile settings area. After logging in:

1. **Look for a "Settings" or "Preferences" option.** This is often accessible by clicking your profile icon/avatar (usually in the top right corner) or through a main navigation menu.  
2. **Navigate to the relevant sections.** Settings are often organized into categories like "General," "Notifications," "Privacy," or "Display."

## **Common Preferences You Can Set**

While the exact options might vary slightly between different EducationPub instances, here are some common preferences you can typically adjust:

### **1\. General Account Settings**

* **Display Language:** If the platform supports multiple languages, you can often choose your preferred language for the user interface. This changes the language of menus, buttons, and system messages.  
* **Time Zone:** Setting your correct time zone ensures that timestamps on posts and activities are accurate for your location.

### **2\. Notification Preferences**

Notifications keep you informed about important activities. You can usually control:

* **Types of Notifications:**  
  * **New Followers:** Get alerted when someone starts following you.  
  * **Mentions/Replies:** Be notified when someone replies to your post or mentions your username.  
  * **New Content from Followed Users:** Receive alerts when people you follow publish new educational content (e.g., a new Story, Flashcard, or Exercise).  
  * **Assessment Submissions/Feedback:** If you're an educator, get notified when learners submit assessments or when peer reviews are completed. If you're a learner, get notified when you receive feedback on your submissions.  
  * **Progress Updates:** Alerts related to your learning objectives and key results (e.g., "You've achieved a Key Result\!").  
* **Notification Channels:**  
  * **In-App Notifications:** Alerts that appear directly within the EducationPub platform (e.g., in a notification bell icon).  
  * **Email Notifications:** Receive summaries or specific alerts via email.  
  * **Push Notifications (if supported):** Get alerts directly to your device if you're using a mobile app or have enabled browser notifications.

### **3\. Privacy Settings**

These settings help you control who sees your content and interactions:

* **Default Post Visibility:** Choose whether your posts are public by default, visible only to your followers, or unlisted. You can usually override this for individual posts.  
* **Profile Visibility:** Control whether your profile is discoverable in searches or visible to logged-out users.  
* **Direct Messages:** Manage who can send you direct messages.

### **4\. Content and Display Preferences**

* **Content Filters:** You might be able to filter out certain types of content or content with specific tags if you prefer not to see them in your main feeds.  
* **Theme/Appearance:** Some platforms offer options to change the visual theme (e.g., light mode, dark mode) or font sizes.  
* **Media Display:** Preferences for how images or videos are displayed (e.g., always show, click to expand).

## **Saving Your Changes**

Always remember to click the "Save," "Update Settings," or "Apply" button after making any changes to your preferences. Your new settings will then take effect, customizing your EducationPub experience.  
By setting your preferences, you ensure that EducationPub works best for you, helping you focus on the content and connections that matter most to your learning journey.

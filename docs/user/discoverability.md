# **Promoting Yourself and Others on EducationPub**

EducationPub is a collaborative network, and a big part of that is sharing valuable content and helping others discover great resources. Whether you're an educator showcasing your lessons or a learner highlighting useful materials, promoting content is easy and helps the entire community thrive.

## **Promoting Your Own Content**

When you create educational resources on EducationPub, you want them to reach the right audience. Here's how you can promote your own work:

1. **Create Engaging Content:**  
   * The best promotion starts with high-quality, useful, and well-structured educational materials. Focus on creating clear, concise flashcards, informative stories, well-designed assessments, or insightful objectives.  
2. **Use Relevant Tags (Hashtags):**  
   * When you publish any content (Flashcards, Stories, Exercises, etc.), make sure to add relevant tags (hashtags). Tags help your content appear in searches and filtered feeds.  
   * **Example:** If you create a French vocabulary flashcard deck, use tags like \#FrenchVocabulary, \#LanguageLearning, \#A1French. If you publish an algebra lesson, use \#Algebra, \#MathEducation, \#HighSchoolMath.  
3. **Share Your Profile Link:**  
   * Your EducationPub profile has a unique URL (web address). You can share this link on other social media platforms, in emails, or on your personal website to invite people to follow you and discover your content.  
4. **Announce New Content:**  
   * After creating a new Story, Video Lesson, or Assessment, you can often make a short "Announce" post (sometimes called a "Note" or just a regular post) to your followers. This is like saying, "Hey, I just published a new resource, check it out\!" Include a link to the new content in your announcement.  
5. **Engage with Others:**  
   * Participate in discussions, reply to posts, and interact with content from others. Being an active and helpful member of the community can naturally draw attention to your own profile and contributions.

## **Promoting Content from Others**

Discovering and sharing valuable resources from other educators and learners is a fantastic way to support the community and enrich your own network.

1. **Boost (Re-share) Content:**  
   * The most direct way to promote someone else's content is to "Boost" or "Re-share" it. When you boost a post (a Story, an Exercise, an Objective, etc.), it appears in the feeds of your followers, even if they don't follow the original author. This helps spread good content far and wide.  
   * **How to Boost:** Look for the re-share or boost icon (often two arrows forming a square) below the post.  
2. **Like Posts:**  
   * While not a direct "promotion" in terms of visibility to others' feeds, "Liking" a post shows appreciation and can signal to the original author that their content is valued. It also adds the content to your "Liked Posts" collection, making it easy for you to revisit.  
3. **Reply and Comment:**  
   * Leaving thoughtful replies or comments on someone's educational content can highlight its value and spark further discussion. Your comment might encourage others to check out the original post.  
4. **Quote and Share (with Attribution):**  
   * If you want to share a specific part of someone's content or add your own commentary, you can often "Quote" their post. Always make sure to clearly attribute the original author when you do this.  
5. **Directly Recommend:**  
   * If you know someone who would benefit from a specific piece of content, you can share the link to it directly with them through private messages or other communication channels.

By actively promoting both your own creations and the valuable contributions of others, you help build a vibrant, interconnected, and supportive learning environment on EducationPub.

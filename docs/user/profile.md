# **Setting Up Your EducationPub Profile**

Your profile is how others on EducationPub (and the wider Fediverse\!) will see you. Taking a few moments to set it up can help you connect with other learners and educators.

## **Accessing Your Profile Settings**

After you've logged in, you'll typically find your profile settings in one of these common locations:

1. **Profile Icon/Avatar:** Look for a small circle with your initial or a placeholder image, usually in the top right corner of the screen. Clicking this often reveals a dropdown menu.  
2. **Navigation Menu:** There might be a "Profile," "Settings," or "Account" link in the main navigation menu (sometimes on the left sidebar or top bar).

Once you find the link, click on it to navigate to your profile editing page.

## **Key Profile Elements to Set Up**

Here are the common elements you can customize on your EducationPub profile:

1. **Display Name:**  
   * This is the name that will be shown to other users. You can use your real name, a nickname, or any name you prefer.  
   * **Tip:** Choose something recognizable to your friends or colleagues if you want them to easily find you.  
2. **Avatar (Profile Picture):**  
   * Your avatar is a small image that represents you. It appears next to your posts and comments.  
   * **To upload:** Look for an "Upload," "Change Avatar," or similar button. You'll usually be able to select an image file from your computer or device.  
   * **Tip:** A clear, friendly image helps others recognize you.  
3. **Header/Banner Image (Optional):**  
   * Some platforms allow you to upload a larger image that appears at the top of your profile page, similar to a cover photo.  
   * **To upload:** Look for a "Change Header" or "Upload Banner" option.  
   * **Tip:** This is a great place to express your interests or personality.  
4. **Bio/About Me:**  
   * This is a short description about yourself. You can include:  
     * Your interests in education or learning.  
     * What subjects you teach or are learning.  
     * Your professional role (e.g., "High School Math Teacher," "Lifelong Learner of Languages").  
     * Any other relevant information you'd like to share.  
   * **Tip:** A concise bio helps others understand who you are and what you're interested in.  
5. **Links (Optional):**  
   * You might have the option to add links to other websites, such as your personal blog, professional portfolio, or other social media profiles.  
   * **To add:** Look for fields like "Website," "Link 1," etc., where you can paste the URL and often add a label for it.  
6. **Language Preferences (Optional):**  
   * If the platform supports multiple languages, you might be able to set your preferred display language or the languages you are learning/teaching.

## **Saving Your Changes**

After making any changes to your profile, remember to **save them\!** Look for a "Save," "Update Profile," or "Submit" button, usually at the bottom of the profile editing page.  
Once saved, your updated profile will be visible to others on the platform and across the Fediverse. You're now ready to start exploring and connecting\!

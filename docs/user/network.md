# **Using the Network Features on EducationPub**

EducationPub isn't just about creating and learningâ€”it's also about connecting\! As part of the **Fediverse**, your EducationPub platform can communicate with other EducationPub instances and even other types of Fediverse platforms (like Mastodon or Pixelfed). This means you can build a network of learners, educators, and content that extends far beyond a single website.  
Here's how you can use the network features:

## **1\. Connecting with Other Users**

Finding and connecting with people is a core part of the experience.

* **Finding Friends & Users:**  
  * You can often search for users by their full address, which looks like an email address (e.g., @username@platform.com). If you know someone's Fediverse address, you can typically paste it into a search bar to find their profile.  
  * You might also discover users through their posts on public timelines or by seeing who interacts with content you follow.  
* **Following & Being Followed:**  
  * When you find a user whose content or profile interests you, you can **"Follow"** them. This means their public posts and activities will appear in your personalized feed.  
  * Other users can also follow you, and your public posts will appear in their feeds.  
  * You can usually see a list of who you are **"Following"** and who your **"Followers"** are on your profile page.

## **2\. Interacting with Content**

Once you're connected, you can engage with the content shared by others.

* **Liking Posts:**  
  * To show your appreciation for a post, story, or educational resource, you can "Like" it. Look for a heart icon or a "Like" button. Liking content often adds it to your "Liked Posts" collection for easy access later.  
* **Boosting (Re-sharing) Content:**  
  * If you find a valuable piece of educational content or a post that you want to share with your own followers, you can "Boost" or "Re-share" it. This makes the content appear in your followers' feeds, even if they don't follow the original author. Look for a re-share or boost icon (often two arrows forming a square).  
* **Replying to Posts:**  
  * Most platforms allow you to reply directly to a post. This creates a conversation thread, and your reply will be visible to those who can see the original post and your followers.

## **3\. Understanding the Fediverse**

EducationPub is part of a larger network called the **Fediverse** (a blend of "federation" and "universe").

* **Decentralized Network:** Instead of one giant server, the Fediverse is made up of many independent servers (or "instances") that can talk to each other. Your EducationPub platform is one of these instances.  
* **Seamless Communication:** When you post something publicly on your EducationPub platform, it can be seen by users on other connected EducationPub platforms, and even on other Fediverse services like Mastodon. Similarly, you can follow users and see content from these other platforms directly within your EducationPub account.  
* **Your Data, Your Platform:** Because each platform is independent, its owner sets the rules and moderation policies. This gives you more control and choice over where you participate.

## **4\. Your Personal Network Spaces**

Your EducationPub account provides dedicated spaces for managing your interactions:

* **Your Inbox:** This is where you receive all activities from others, including new followers, replies to your posts, and content shared directly with you.  
* **Your Outbox:** This is where your own posts and activities are stored before they are sent out to your followers and the Fediverse.  
* **Public Feed:** Many platforms offer a "Public Feed" or "Local Timeline" where you can see all public posts from users on your specific EducationPub instance. This is a great way to discover new content and people on your home server.

By using these network features, you can build a vibrant learning community, share valuable resources, and engage in discussions across the decentralized educational landscape of the Fediverse.

Chloe's Geology Journey on EducationPub: A Visual and Data-Driven Approach
This document outlines a prospective user journey for Chloe, a university student studying geology, as she might use the EducationPub platform. Her journey focuses on leveraging the platform's ability to organize visual data, create complex models, and collaborate with her peers on hands-on, field-based projects.

Persona: Chloe

<img src="/personas/Chloe.png" align="left" style={{margin: '30px', marginTop: '0px' }} width="200" height="200" alt="Generated image of Chloe" />

Name: Chloe

Age: 21 (University Student)

Background: Chloe is a third-year geology major. She is passionate about fieldwork but struggles with the immense amount of data she collects, from field notes and sketches to rock samples and photos. She finds it difficult to synthesize information from various sources and mentally visualize complex 3D geological structures from 2D textbook diagrams.

Motivation: Her ultimate goal is to become a field geologist for an environmental consulting firm. To get there, she needs to master core concepts like structural geology and petrology, and she wants a reliable, searchable digital notebook for all her field data that she can reference throughout her career.

Current Support: University lectures, lab sessions, and fieldwork. She uses a physical notebook for field notes, her phone for photos, and a digital word processor for lab reports. This fragmented workflow makes it difficult to connect her observations to her lab work and course material.

Learning Style: Highly visual and spatial. She learns best by drawing, sketching, and building models. She requires tools that can help her organize visual information and convert abstract concepts into concrete, manipulable representations.

Core Principles for Chloe's Journey:

Chloe's journey on EducationPub will be designed around:

Visual Data Organization: Providing a central hub to store and tag diverse media, including photos, diagrams, and notes.

Spatial and Conceptual Modeling: Offering tools to help her create visual representations of complex, multi-dimensional geological structures.

Field-to-Lab Integration: Creating a seamless workflow from on-site data collection to in-lab analysis and report writing.

Collaborative Project Management: Enabling her to easily share field observations and lab data with her partners for group projects.

Chloe's User Journey on EducationPub

Phase 1: Onboarding & Initial Setup

Discovery: Chloe's professor or a peer in her lab group recommends EducationPub as a good tool for organizing field notes. She's drawn to the promise of a single place for all her project data.

Registration & Profile: Chloe registers for an account using Local User Management. She sets up her profile, indicating her major is Geology and her interest is in fieldwork.

Connecting with Lab Partners: She uses the Find Friends feature to follow her lab group members, creating a dedicated space for their collaborative project.

Phase 2: Data Collection & Content Creation

Creating a Field Notebook: Chloe starts a new FlashcardModel Creation for her Geology class field trip. Her flashcard model has fields for "Location," "Photo," "Field Sketch," "Rock Type," and "Observations."

Populating Content in the Field: As she takes notes in the field, she creates Flashcard Instance Creation for each new rock outcrop. She attaches photos she takes on her phone, sketches she draws in her notebook (by taking a picture of the sketch), and a short summary of her observations. This creates a digitally searchable, organized field notebook.

Creating a Rock Identification Set: Back in the lab, she creates a separate flashcard set to study different rock types. The model has fields for "Rock Name," "Mineral Composition," "Texture," and "Formation Process." Each flashcard includes a high-resolution photo of the rock sample.

Phase 3: Visualization & Analysis

Structural Geology Diagramming: For her structural geology class, she uses a Proposed Enhancement featuring an interactive diagramming tool. She sketches a cross-section of a geological fold, and the tool helps her label different layers and fault lines. This diagram is saved as a edu:Diagram object.

3D Visualization (Proposed Enhancement): To better understand a complex fault system, she uses a proposed 3D visualization tool. She inputs data from her field notes, and the platform generates a simple, manipulable 3D model that she can rotate and zoom to understand the spatial relationships between different rock layers.

Quiz for Identification: Before a lab exam, Chloe uses the Customizable Quiz Generation (Proposed Enhancement) to quiz herself on her rock identification flashcard set. The quiz shows a photo of a rock and asks her to name it, its composition, and its texture, providing immediate feedback.

Phase 4: Collaboration & Reporting

Sharing Field Data: Chloe shares her "Field Notebook" flashcard set with her lab group using the Seamless Sharing (Proposed Enhancement) feature. They can then collectively review the data, add their own observations via replies, and prepare for their group presentation.

Peer Review of Diagrams: Her lab partner, who is also using the platform, reviews her diagram of the geological fold. They can provide feedback and annotations on the diagram itself, which Chloe can then use to improve her work.

Final Report Synthesis: When it's time to write their final lab report, Chloe and her group can easily pull their organized field notes, photos, and diagrams directly from EducationPub, streamlining their workflow and ensuring all their data is in one place.

Summary of Benefits for Chloe with EducationPub:

Existing MVP Features:

Content Creation: Empowers her to create structured digital field notebooks and flashcard sets for data and concepts.

User & Peer Connection: The "Follow" feature enables seamless collaboration with her lab group on shared projects.

Public Feed & Liking: Allows her to discover and save content related to geology concepts.

Proposed Enhancements (Critical for Academic Success):

Interactive Diagramming Tool: A feature for sketching and labeling geological diagrams directly on the platform.

3D Visualization Tool: An intuitive tool to build simple 3D models from field data, aiding in spatial understanding.

Media-Rich Content Models: Flashcard models that prioritize visual and photographic data, making them ideal for subjects like geology.

Seamless Sharing: A simple "Share Link" feature to easily distribute her curated materials to her study group.

Collaborative Annotation: The ability for peers to add comments or markups directly on diagrams and photos for effective peer review.
